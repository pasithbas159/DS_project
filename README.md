# Data Science & Data Analytic project
This is my self project on data analytics and data science process.

Here's my project & knowledge that I have learned and use.
## Kaggle Competition

## Self-learned mini-project: 
1. [UCI student grading](UCI_spyder.py) : Create a pipeline apply with Multiple Linear Regression.
2. [UCI breast cancer classification](https://github.com/pasithbas159/DS_project/blob/master/Breast%20cancer.ipynb) : Breast cancer classification (malignant or benign) mainly on Logistic Regression
3. [MNIST handwritten](MNIST_dataset.ipynb) : Hand written classification. So I use typical classification technique (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) and feature engineering technique (Standardization and Dimensional Reduction).
4. [COVID-19 cases predicted](corona_cases/corona_cases_predicted.ipynb) : Research Assistant mini-project that dealing with time-series data. Autoregression, Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing are the technique that I try to use.
5. [CIFAR-10 object recognition](CNN_cifar10.ipynb) : Object recognition problem to classifies 10 classes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Data Augmentation is the key to achieve classification goal.
6. [text analysis mini-project](Mushroom_extract.ipynb) : This is my second Research Assistant mini-project to do text analysis. First, I use pythainlp with attacut engine to do word tokenize. Then I use n-grams to see those words that correspond to the topic.For example, If we use 3-grams we'll saw mushroom species ('เห็ด', 'นางรม', 'ฮังการี').
7. [NLP application with Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/pasithbas159/DS_project/blob/master/NLP%20Project/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) : The second NLP project is Sentiment Analysis. I use tensorflow tokenizer to tokenize words and collect them to vector. Then I apply my Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to those vector such as Single LSTM, Embedding Neural Network, 1D Convolutional and GRUs to classify sentiment from texts.
8. [IBM employee analysis](IBM_employee_analysis) : Data Analytics & Visualization project to solve the problem that the company faces such as predicting and finding the factors that could effect employees are likely to leave the company.
9. [python OOP project](arcade_game_project) : My first python game that I created using arcade to improve my OOP programing and it's very fun to build :)
10. [Data Analytics Web Application using Streamlit](https://github.com/pasithbas159/streamlit-analytics)
11. [Data Science Web Application using Streamlit](https://github.com/pasithbas159/streamlit-analytics)
